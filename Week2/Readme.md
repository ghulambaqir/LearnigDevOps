# Pair Programming
 Pair programming is a development technique in which two programmers work together at single workstation. Person who writes code is called a **driver**   and a person who observes and navigates each line of the code is called **navigator**.
 They may switch their role frequently. 
 Sometimes pair programming is also known as **pairing**.
 
 ## Advantages of Pair Programming :
 
- Two brains are always better than one – If driver encounters a problem with code, there will be two of them who’ll solve problem. 
 When driver is writing code, navigator can think about a solution to problem.
 
- Detection of coding mistakes becomes easier – Navigator is observing each and every line of code written by driver, so mistakes or error can be
 detected easily.

- Mutual learning – Both of them can share their knowledge with each other and can learn many new things together.
 Team develops better communication skills – Both of them share knowledge and work together for many hours a day and constantly share information with 
 each other so this can help in developing better communication skills, especially when one of members is a newbie and other is an expert.

## Disadvantages of Pair Programming:

+ Team Fit – High-intensity communication of pair programming is not a good fit for every developer. Sometimes, drivers are supposed to speak loud 
 as they write code. Some people may not agree on idea of sitting, literally shoulder-to-shoulder, with a colleague for eight hours a day. 
 Some experienced developers are more productive in solo rather than in pair programming.
 
+ Newbie-newbie pairing problem – Newbie–newbie pairing can produce results better than two newbie working independently, although this practice
 is generally avoided because it is harder for newbie to develop good habits without a proper role model.
 
 
 
 
 # What is Extreme Programming?
 eXtreme Programming (XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of software development by small teams in the face of vague and changing requirements.

Extreme Programming is one of the Agile software development methodologies. It provides values and principles to guide the team behavior. The team is expected to self-organize. Extreme Programming provides specific core practices where 

+ Each practice is simple and self-complete.

+ Combination of practices produces more complex and emergent behavior.


## History of Extreme Programming
Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham and Ron Jeffries formulated extreme Programming in 1999. The other contributors are Robert Martin and Martin Fowler.

In Mid-80s, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham initiated Pair Programming at Tektronix. In the 80s and 90s, Smalltalk Culture produced Refactoring, Continuous Integration, constant testing, and close customer involvement. This culture was later generalized to the other environments.

In the Early 90s, Core Values were developed within the Patterns Community, Hillside Group. In 1995, Kent summarized these in Smalltalk Best Practices, and in 1996, Ward summarized it in episodes.

In 1996, Kent added unit testing and metaphor at Hewitt. In 1996, Kent had taken the Chrysler C3 project, to which Ron Jeffries was added as a coach. The practices were refined on C3 and published on Wiki.

Scrum practices were incorporated and adapted as the planning game. In 1999, Kent published his book, ‘Extreme Programming Explained’. In the same year, Fowler published his book, Refactoring.

Extreme Programming has been evolving since then, and the evolution continues through today.

Success in Industry
The success of projects, which follow Extreme Programming practices, is due to −

- Rapid development.

- Immediate responsiveness to the customer’s changing requirements.

- Focus on low defect rates.

- System returning constant and consistent value to the customer.

- High customer satisfaction.

- Reduced costs.

- Team cohesion and employee satisfaction.


### Extreme Programming in a Nutshell 
Extreme Programming involves −

+ Writing unit tests before programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times. The unit tests are automated and eliminates defects early, thus reducing the costs.

+ Starting with a simple design just enough to code the features at hand and redesigning when required.

+ Programming in pairs (called pair programming), with two programmers at one screen, taking turns to use the keyboard. While one of them is at the keyboard, the other constantly reviews and provides inputs.

+ Integrating and testing the whole system several times a day.

+ Putting a minimal working system into the production quickly and upgrading it whenever required.

+ Keeping the customer involved all the time and obtaining constant feedback.

Iterating facilitates the accommodating changes as the software evolves with the changing requirements.

## When should Extreme Programming be Used?

+ XP was also set up to address the problems of project risk. If your customers need a new system by a specific date the risk is high. If that system is a new challenge for your software group the risk is even greater. If that system is a new challenge to the entire software industry the risk is greater even still. The XP practices are set up to mitigate the risk and increase the likelihood of success.
+ XP requires an extended development team. The XP team includes not only the developers, but the managers and customers as well, all working together elbow to elbow. Asking questions, negotiating scope and schedules, and creating functional tests require more than just the developers be involved in producing the software.
+ XP is set up for small groups of programmers. Between 2 and 12, though larger projects of 30 have reported success. Your programmers can be ordinary, you don't need programmers with a Ph.D. to use XP. But you can not use XP on a project with a huge staff. We should note that on projects with dynamic requirements or high risk you may find that a small team of XP programmers will be more effective than a large team anyway.
+ Another requirement is testability. You must be able to create automated unit and functional tests. While some domains will be disqualified by this requirement, you may be surprised how many are not. You do need to apply a little testing ingenuity in some domains. You may need to change your system design to be easier to test. Just remember, where there is a will there is a way to test.
+ The last thing on the list is productivity. XP projects unanimously report greater programmer productivity when compared to other projects within the same corporate environment. But this was never a goal of the XP methodology. The real goal has always been to deliver the software that is needed when it is needed.
