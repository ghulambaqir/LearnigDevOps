# Pair Programming
 Pair programming is a development technique in which two programmers work together at single workstation. Person who writes code is called a **driver** and 
 a person who observes and navigates each line of the code is called **navigator**.
 They may switch their role frequently. 
 Sometimes pair programming is also known as **pairing**.
 
 ## Advantages of Pair Programming :
 
-Two brains are always better than one – If driver encounters a problem with code, there will be two of them who’ll solve problem. 
 When driver is writing code, navigator can think about a solution to problem.
 
-Detection of coding mistakes becomes easier – Navigator is observing each and every line of code written by driver, so mistakes or error can be
 detected easily.

-Mutual learning – Both of them can share their knowledge with each other and can learn many new things together.
 Team develops better communication skills – Both of them share knowledge and work together for many hours a day and constantly share information with 
 each other so this can help in developing better communication skills, especially when one of members is a newbie and other is an expert.

## Disadvantages of Pair Programming :

-Team Fit – High-intensity communication of pair programming is not a good fit for every developer. Sometimes, drivers are supposed to speak loud 
 as they write code. Some people may not agree on idea of sitting, literally shoulder-to-shoulder, with a colleague for eight hours a day. 
 Some experienced developers are more productive in solo rather than in pair programming.
-Newbie-newbie pairing problem – Newbie–newbie pairing can produce results better than two newbie working independently, although this practice
 is generally avoided because it is harder for newbie to develop good habits without a proper role model.
